  # Summary
  This project was created as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python) course.<br>
  This project is a simple clone of the game asteroids, with the game ending if you hit a asteroid.
  The project focuses on learning to use classes and OOP concepts to build a clone of the game asteroids.
  # Disclaimer
  The code is about 50% me and 50% provided by Boot.dev, that being said I still understand a lot of the code base and could explain what is going on if asked.
   The main foucs of the project was not to build asteroids from statch but was to practice classes and OOP design with a project, hence why some of the code is provided.
